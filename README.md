- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This is what I learned from this project;
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

I want to learn more on JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me with the dropdown navigation bar and the javascript.
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) - This helped me with more knowledge on the toogle bar.
